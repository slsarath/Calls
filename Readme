Perfect — this is exactly the kind of code you want to be able to explain clearly. Here’s how you can break it down into clean, manager-level pointers that convey both the logic and the business value without sounding overly technical.

🧩 What the Code Does — Big Picture

This script matches Laws, Rules & Regulations (LRRs) to internal controls by comparing the text of each regulation against the text of each control description.
The goal is to automatically identify which controls are most relevant or compliant with a particular regulation.

⸻

🧠 How It Works — Step-by-Step

You can explain it like this:
	1.	Input Data
	•	Laws/Regulations dataframe → contains LRRid and Detailed obligation description
	•	Control library dataframe → contains ControlId and Control Description
	2.	Text Cleaning
	•	The script first removes extra spaces, newlines, and symbols so comparisons are consistent.
	•	Example: “12 CFR 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)” → treated the same way in both datasets.
	3.	Multiple Matching Techniques
It uses six independent methods to find similarity between texts:
	•	Semantic similarity: Uses Sentence Transformers (AI embeddings) to understand meaning.
Example: “notify customers before rate increase” ≈ “send 45-day notice before APR hike”
	•	N-gram overlap: Looks for shared word patterns or phrases (like 2–3 word sequences).
	•	Jaccard similarity: Measures overlap of unique words between the two texts.
	•	Fuzzy matching: Handles wording variations (e.g., “rate increase notice” ≈ “notice of rate change”).
	•	Regex section matching: Specifically checks for matching legal citations (like “12 CFR 1026.9”).
	•	Phrase matching: Detects common longer sequences of words that appear in both texts.
	4.	Scoring and Normalization
	•	Each of the six methods gives a score from 0 to 1 (higher = more similar).
	•	These scores are normalized (so they’re comparable) and weighted:
	•	Example: semantic = 3x weight, regex = 2x weight, others = 0.5–1x
	•	A composite score is then calculated — it represents the final similarity.
	5.	Ranking the Controls
	•	For each LRR, the model ranks all controls by the composite score.
	•	The top 3 are selected as the most likely matches.
	6.	Output
	•	The result is a long-format dataframe (or CSV) with:
	•	LRRid
	•	LRR text
	•	Rank (1, 2, 3)
	•	ControlId
	•	Control description
	•	Each method’s individual score
	•	Final composite_score

📊 How to Explain the Output File

Here’s how to walk your manager through it:

Column	Meaning
LRRid	Regulation identifier
Detailed obligation description	Text of the regulation
rank	1 = best match, 3 = third best
ControlId	Matched internal control
Control Description	Control text that aligns with the regulation
semantic / ngram / jaccard / fuzzy / regex / phrase	Raw similarity scores from each technique
*_norm columns	Normalized versions (scaled between 0 and 1)
composite_score	Weighted average of all normalized scores — the overall match strength


⸻

🏗️ How to Interpret Results
	•	High composite score (≈ 0.8–1.0): Very strong match — control likely satisfies that LRR requirement.
	•	Medium score (≈ 0.5–0.7): Partial overlap — may address part of the regulation.
	•	Low score (< 0.4): Probably unrelated or too general.

You can also highlight that:
	•	Regex match presence usually means a direct citation link (e.g., same “12 CFR” reference).
	•	High semantic score means the control conceptually aligns, even if phrasing is different.

⸻

💼 Why This Is Useful

You can pitch it like this:
	•	Automates manual mapping: Instead of reading hundreds of regulatory texts, the system pre-suggests control matches.
	•	Improves coverage: Combines AI-based (semantic) and rule-based (regex, n-grams) approaches to catch both explicit and implicit links.
	•	Transparent and tunable: Each method’s score is visible; weights can be adjusted per use case.
	•	Scalable: Works across thousands of obligations and controls with minimal manual review.

🔧 Example Talking Line

“We built a hybrid matching system that reads both regulatory text and our control descriptions.
It scores each potential pair across semantic, lexical, and citation-based methods.
The output gives us a ranked list of controls most relevant to each regulation — effectively a machine-assisted control mapping.”
