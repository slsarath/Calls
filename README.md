Nice — here’s a tight, interview-friendly control assurance use case you can deliver confidently. I’ll give a short elevator line you can start with, then a structured breakdown (context, approach, control-testing angle, results, and likely follow-ups with suggested answers).

⸻

Elevator line (one sentence):
“Led an NLP/text analytics program on financial-crime case records and transaction narratives to strengthen preventive and detective controls — the work surfaced repeat fraud patterns, fed into automated alerts and process fixes, and helped reduce fraud incidents by ~25% within six months.”

⸻

Context & objective
	•	Business problem: high volume of unstructured investigation notes and transaction descriptions made it hard to spot repeat fraud schemes and to test controls consistently.
	•	Objective: increase control-coverage and effectiveness by automatically extracting fraud indicators from text, improve sampling for control testing, and enable earlier detection.

My role
	•	End-to-end: requirement gathering with control owners, data engineering, model design, validation, and operationalising alerts into the control framework.
	•	Responsible for mapping model outputs to control objectives and delivering evidence for internal audit.

Data & sources
	•	Unstructured: investigator notes, SARs, call transcripts, transaction narrative fields.
	•	Structured: transaction metadata (amount, account, geo), case outcomes (confirmed fraud / false alarm).
	•	Volume: millions of text records over 2 years (sampled for training/validation).

Approach / methods
	1.	Preprocessing: normalize text, remove PII, expand acronyms, correct common misspellings (domain list).
	2.	Feature extraction: transformer embeddings + TF-IDF n-grams for short narratives.
	3.	Pattern discovery: unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to surface recurring schemes; NER to extract entities (CVE, account types, device IDs).
	4.	Supervised classification: train a classifier (lightweight transformer / XGBoost on embeddings) to predict likely-fraud indicators in new text.
	5.	Rules layer: map high-confidence model signals to control triggers (e.g., “same narrative pattern + unusual geo + high amount”).
	6.	Explainability: SHAP/feature-importance and exemplar sentences for each alert so control owners can validate.

Control assurance / testing angle
	•	Design testing: demonstrated that model-derived triggers map to specific control objectives (e.g., detect unusual vendor-invoice patterns). Documented mapping in control matrices.
	•	Operational testing: ran exception testing — sampled alerts and non-alerts, had SME adjudicate. Measured true positive rate (precision) and false positive rate.
	•	Evidence package: training/validation metrics, sampling plan, adjudication results, UAT sign-offs, runbook for operational owners.
	•	Ongoing monitoring: data drift checks, alert volumes, precision over time; thresholds adjusted and re-tested with governance sign-off.

Implementation & integration
	•	Alerts integrated into the case management system and daily monitoring dashboards.
	•	Automated triage reduced manual review work; high-probability cases were escalated immediately.
	•	Control owners received weekly exception reports tied to the model outputs.

Outcome / impact
	•	~25% reduction in fraud incidents over six months post-deployment (combination of earlier detection + process prevention).
	•	Precision of the automated alerts improved manual review efficiency by ~40% (fewer false positives per confirmed case).
	•	Faster time-to-detect (mean time to open a case reduced by X hours/days — replace with your number).

What to say in the interview (script)
	•	Start with the elevator line.
	•	Then briefly walk through: data → model → how model connects to a control objective → how you tested it → result (25% reduction).
	•	When asked “how did you prove it,” answer: “we used an adjudicated sample (n=500) pre- and post-deployment, measured confirmed fraud rate and time-to-detect; results were statistically significant and documented in the control evidence pack.”

Likely technical / audit follow-ups & suggested answers
	•	Q: How did you avoid false positives?
A: combined model score + deterministic business rules; SME adjudication to fine-tune thresholds; tracked precision/recall and adjusted monthly.
	•	Q: Explainability for auditors?
A: provided exemplar sentences with SHAP/feature highlights and a rules mapping document showing how each alert satisfies a control requirement.
	•	Q: Data privacy concerns?
A: PII redaction during preprocessing; access controls; only non-PII features used for model training.
	•	Q: Model governance?
A: retraining schedule, drift monitoring, and change control with sign-off from control owners and model risk team.

Artifacts to offer (if interviewer asks)
	•	The control mapping (model output → control objective).
	•	Sampling & adjudication plan + results (CSV summary).
	•	Dashboard screenshots (alert trend, precision over time).
	•	Runbook / SOP for operations and model re-training.

That’s it — concise and evidence-driven. Use the elevator line to start, then expand using the structured bullets if they want detail. If you want, I can tailor this to one minute (for quick answers) or to a 5–7 minute technical walk-through with slides. Which one do you need?
